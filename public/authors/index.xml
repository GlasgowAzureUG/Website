      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Glasgow Azure User Group! This user group was founded as an independent body in early 2017 and it looks to bring the IT community within Glasgow and surrounding areas together. The group is a community driven group delivering the type of content, speakers and experiences that the IT community in Glasgow wants. The group is open to developers, architects, consultants, engineers and enthusiasts. Participating in GAUG meetups has many benefits including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn best practices and optimal use of Microsoft’s Cloud platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get answers, advice, tips and suggestions from peers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain insights into what others are doing within Azure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network with local peers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <guid>https://ashy-hill-052747203.azurestaticapps.net/authors/sarah/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With a diverse career that spans over fifteen years, Sarah has been a part of every aspect of the IT world. She began at the bottom of the industry, working hard at the small jobs until she earned her way to her current position. With determination, Sarah accomplished her goals, getting things done in a timely, intelligent way. This led her to see things on a bigger scope as her passion for technology deepened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born and raised on a dairy farm in Scotland, Sarah holds true to her heritage by embracing the natural world through her appreciation for technology. For Sarah, technology is a way to see life as it grows and adapts, ever-changing, just like the natural world of farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah is proud to give back to her community. As a STEM Ambassador, Sarah helps others learn how IT can impact and change their lives for the better. Most specifically, she enjoys teaching the next generation of young women how they too can rise in a male-oriented field and succeed in their own careers. Sarah also founded the Glasgow Azure User Group, a community collective who meets bimonthly to network and discuss the latest in technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah’s enthusiasm in the field of technology has given her the opportunity to speak at public events, most notably, Microsoft Ignite.&lt;/p&gt;
